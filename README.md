# My first pet-project on React.

## Stack that was used in this project:

- ReactJS + hooks

- React Router Axios

- React Context

- React Skeleton

- SCSS

### Functionality:
I used a [MockApi](https://mockapi.io/) as a BackEnd server. All orders are saved in personal account. 
Also, cart and favourites save their state after reloading.
